# Technical Debt: Definitions and Interpretations

## General Definition

**Technical debt** refers to the additional work or cost that arises in software development when quality is compromised for short-term goals, such as meeting deadlines or accelerating delivery.

**Examples:**
- "We should refactor this, but let's ship it as-is for now to meet the deadline."
- "We don’t have time to write tests right now; we’ll write them later."

→ As a result, it becomes harder and more costly to modify or extend the code in the future.

## Broad Interpretation (Wider Usage Today)

The term "technical debt" has expanded beyond code quality issues and is now used to refer to **a wide range of technical, organizational, or operational inefficiencies**.

### Examples of Broad Usage:
- Inadequate or missing documentation
- Lack of knowledge sharing (tacit knowledge)
- Over-reliance on specific individuals (key-person risk)
- Legacy system maintenance
- Insufficient test automation or CI/CD pipelines
- Inefficient architecture or outdated operations

→ The term now often includes **organizational or procedural issues**, not just technical ones.

## Original (Narrow) Definition

### Origin:
The term "technical debt" was coined by **Ward Cunningham** in 1992.

### Original Meaning:
Technical debt was meant to describe a **strategic decision**: choosing a less-than-optimal design or implementation **intentionally** to achieve short-term business goals, with the understanding that the design will be improved later.

Ward likened this to financial debt:
- **Deliver early to gain business value**
- **Pay "interest" later in the form of refactoring or additional work**

Importantly, **intentionality** is a key element. Poor implementation due to mistakes or ignorance does **not** fall under the original concept of technical debt.

| Aspect               | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| General Definition   | Future costs caused by compromising on quality |
| Broad Interpretation | Includes technical, organizational, and procedural deficiencies |
| Narrow (Original)    | Strategic compromise to gain short-term value |
| Key Point            | Recognizing and managing debt is essential for sustainability |

## Notes

- **Technical debt grows** if not addressed ("interest accrues").
- **Not all debt is bad** — it can be a valid business strategy.
- **Tracking and managing debt** explicitly allows for strategic planning.
